# Marksweeper

Pygame implementation of the Minesweeper classic.

- Use the right mouse button to mark (red dot).
    - Marked cells cannot be revealed.
    - To unmark a cell, press the right mouse button again.
- Use the left mouse button to reveal.
- When you find a mine (bee, troll, etc.) the game ends.
    - Correctly marked cells turn into green mines.
    - Remaining red dots are incorrectly marked.
- After winning or losing the game, press 'r' to restart.
